OceanEye AI is a web-based platform that leverages deep learning and computer vision to analyze ocean water images and detect pollution levels. The system classifies water quality into different contamination categories by analyzing color distribution, texture patterns, and pixel-level variations.

By integrating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with a scalable web interface, the platform enables automated and efficient marine pollution monitoring.

This solution aims to assist environmental agencies, NGOs, and researchers in identifying contaminated regions quickly and effectively.
